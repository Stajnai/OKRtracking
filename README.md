# Optokinetic Response Tracking Software (Senior Thesis)

## Purpose
#### Video Explanation: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OEmxjHBf3E]
  The Carthage College neuroscience department is taking part in research of the natural regenerative capabilities of the optical nerve in zebrafish, also known as *danio rerio*. As part of the study, a zebrafish's optical nerve is crushed and then the fish is observed as it regains vision. To test the capabilities of the eye, the optokinetic response (OKR) is recorded; this response is a natural reflex that stabilizes the eye during visual tracking (An example of this reflex can be seen here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LInm9cZcHyk]).The ocular angle formed by the axis of the eye and the long middle axis of the fish can be measured and graphed to show the OKR.
  The means of analysis for **adult** zebrafish at Carthage is manually analyzing each frame of the video. There is currently no open source software that provides analysis of the videos for adult zebrafish. (There is software available for the larval fish based on their lack of pigmentation but is not usable for adults.) This software helps semi-automate the analysis of the videos and reduces the time per video from ~8 hours of manual time to ~2.5 minutes via software.
